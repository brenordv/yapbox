# YapBox Project
This project has a collection of tools to talk to an LLM model (like OpenAI's GPT-3) and handle the responses.
It's divided into two main parts: 
- Backend: Where all the magic happens. It's a Python project that uses FastAPI to create a REST API (and also has a CLI).
- Frontend: A simple React app that consumes the API.


Note: I'm pretty happy with the backend, especially with the decorators I created. I'll probably create a package for 
them in the future.... maybe.
